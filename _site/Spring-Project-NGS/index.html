  <h1>Spring 2018 Project- Admit-Ed</h1>

  <div class="entry">
    <p>May 4, 2018</p>

<p>In spring 2018 we expanded on the Admit-Ed project for Next Generation Scholars. We worked with two key members of the non-profit to determine what their goals for the technology were, and scoped out specific feature adds to help them meet those goals, and delivered a product that they deployed this summer with 50 of their students.</p>

<h3 id="find-the-live-site-and-code-here">Find the <a href="https://next-generation-scholars.herokuapp.com/">live site</a> and <a href="https://github.com/hack4impact/next-gen-scholars">code</a> here!</h3>

<h1 id="features">Features:</h1>

<h2 id="auto-populated-college-profiles">Auto-Populated College Profiles</h2>

<p>We import updated college profile information from ed.gov to ensure that the data Admit-Ed provides to students is accurate and up-to-date. Via google translate, we are also able to provide this information in Spanish for parents and students.</p>

<p><img src="/images/college_profile_spanish.png" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<h2 id="scattergrams">Scattergrams</h2>

<p>Admit-Ed provides functionality on College Profile pages to show scattergrams of students’ admit statuses based on their GPA and test scores. They are able to add this information via a CSV upload. This will allow Next Generation Scholars to provide this sort of graph data specifically for the local students that they serve.</p>

<h2 id="student-profile">Student Profile</h2>

<p>We provided an easy way for students to track their interested colleges/majors, their applications for schools and for scholarships, and the net cost to them of different schools they’ve been accepted to via a student profile.</p>

<p><img src="/images/student_profile.png" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<h2 id="student-database">Student Database</h2>

<p>We also ensured counselors who work at Next Generation Scholars are able to view and filter all students in the system based on essay status etc. This allows the counselors to make sure they keep on top of their students and provides more of the college counseling relationship.</p>

<p><img src="/images/student_database.png" alt="_config.yml" /></p>

<h2 id="view-and-search-colleges">View and Search Colleges</h2>

<p>Students and counselors can view and search through lists of colleges. Colleges can also be sorted by deadline for admission or financial aid.</p>

title: Fall 2018 Outing- Laser Tag
---

November 17, 2018

Our fall 2018 outing was officially a success! After a few roadblocks (including a set of flat tires and a sprained ankle), most of the group was able to make it to Lasertron Arena for a couple games of laser tag to celebrate a semester's worth of hard work. Great job so far this semester, everyone!

title: Fall 2018 Project- the College Readiness Initiative
---

December 18, 2018

In fall 2018 we worked with the Richmond nonprofit the College Readiness Initiative. This nonprofit was actually founded by a University of Richmond alum! We built upon an existing version of the site created for the nonprofit by one of our cofounders, adding features that allow for authentication, tracking of student progress, and data analytics for the nonprofit.

The website will be used in tutoring sessions in eight different Richmond Public High Schools beginning in 2019!

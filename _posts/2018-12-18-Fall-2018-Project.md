title: Fall 2018 Project- the College Readiness Initiative
---

December 18, 2018

In fall 2018 we worked with the Richmond nonprofit the College Readiness Initiative. This nonprofit was actually founded by a University of Richmond alum! We built upon an existing version of the site created for the nonprofit by one of our cofounders, adding features that allow for authentication, tracking of student progress, and data analytics for the nonprofit.

The website will be used in tutoring sessions in eight different Richmond Public High Schools beginning in 2019!

# Features:

## Authentication

The site features 3 user types: Student, Tutor, and Admin. Students can enter their school, past SAT scores, graduation year, and more.

## Sort and answer questions by category

Students can practice question by question according to question category, receive instant feedback about their answers, and review all the questions they've completed.

## Review all missed and completed questions

Students can go back and review all the questions they've missed or gotten correct, and view the answers to those questions.

## Tools for tutors during tutoring sessions

Tutors can view the answers for all questions for quick access during tutoring sessions.

## Admin can view stats about tutoring sessions and students

This allows the nonprofit to better keep track of data about the number of students they're reaching.

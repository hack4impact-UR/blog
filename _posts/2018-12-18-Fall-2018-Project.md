title: Fall 2018 Project- the College Readiness Initiative
---

December 18, 2018

In fall 2018 we worked with the Richmond nonprofit the College Readiness Initiative. This nonprofit was actually founded by a University of Richmond alum! We built upon an existing version of the site created for the nonprofit by our cofounder Melissa Gu, adding features that allow for authentication, tracking of student progress, and data analytics for the nonprofit.

The website will be used in tutoring sessions in 8 different Richmond Public High Schools beginning in 2019!

# Features:

## Auto-Populated College Profiles 

We import updated college profile information from ed.gov to ensure that the data Admit-Ed provides to students is accurate and up-to-date. Via google translate, we are also able to provide this information in Spanish for parents and students.

## Scattergrams

Admit-Ed provides functionality on College Profile pages to show scattergrams of students' admit statuses based on their GPA and test scores. They are able to add this information via a CSV upload. This will allow Next Generation Scholars to provide this sort of graph data specifically for the local students that they serve.

## Student Profile

We provided an easy way for students to track their interested colleges/majors, their applications for schools and for scholarships, and the net cost to them of different schools they've been accepted to via a student profile.

## Student Database

We also ensured counselors who work at Next Generation Scholars are able to view and filter all students in the system based on essay status etc. This allows the counselors to make sure they keep on top of their students and provides more of the college counseling relationship.

## View and Search Colleges

Students and counselors can view and search through lists of colleges. Colleges can also be sorted by deadline for admission or financial aid.

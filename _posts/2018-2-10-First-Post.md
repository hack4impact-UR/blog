Hack4Impact is coming to the University of Richmond! This organization was originally founded at the University of Pennsylvania and focuses on leveraging tech skills for good. h4i works to develop a project for a new non-profit organization each semester and is dedicated to upholding the values found at https://hack4impact.org/about/

h4i expanded and added 7 more chapters to their ranks Fall 2017 (more on that here), and h4i@UR is in the second wave of chapter incubation!

h4i@UR is being co-founded by Emily Everett (emily.everett@richmond.edu) and Melissa Gu (melissa.gu@richmond.edu) and is working with a national board member to get everything off the ground smoothly!
